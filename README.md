# Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation

This project features a fundamental Binary Search Tree (BST) implemented in C++. It provides core functionalities such as node insertion, node searching, node deletion, and inorder traversal.

## Project Files

- **BST.cpp**: Contains the source code for the BST implementation.
- **input.txt**: An example input file used for demonstrating BST operations.
- **output.txt**: The file generated from running the program (typically not included in the repository, but here for reference).

## Compilation and Execution

1. *Compile the Source Code*:
   Use a C++ compiler like g++ to build the executable from BST.cpp.
   ```sh
   g++ -o BST BST.cpp
